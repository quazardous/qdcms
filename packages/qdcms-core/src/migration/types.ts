/**
 * @quazardous/qdcore/migration — migration system contracts.
 *
 * **Node-only**. The migration runner uses `node:crypto`, file I/O, and
 * eventually spawns the schema-diff engine (MikroORM SchemaGenerator
 * subclass). Browser bundles must NOT import from here — use the entity
 * layer (`@quazardous/qdcore/entity`) which is environment-agnostic.
 *
 * Vocabulary (mirrors docs/qdcms-glossary.md):
 *   Migration         — one atomic schema change, identified by hash
 *   MigrationContext  — handle passed to `up`/`down` (driver, dialect, ...)
 *   MigrationRunner   — orchestrator (apply, rollback, status, dry-run)
 *   MigrationStore    — system table tracking applied migrations per plugin
 *   schemaHash        — sha256 over canonical(plugin_id + version + schema + dialect)
